Hello there and welcome to Inspire, a starter theme for building simple awesome websites, powered by [Blush](https://github.com/blush-dev){:target="_blank"}. [Blush](https://github.com/blush-dev){:target="_blank"} is a PHP-based flat-file CMS that is under heavy development.

Since you are here, I might as well walk you through a few of the basic functionality.

You can edit this content here by heading over to your `user/content/index.md` and start hacking, Pretty simple, right?

While we're on the subject of content creation, you can add a new about page by adding a `/user/content/about.md` file or `/user/content/about/index.md` instead since Blush supports sub-directories as well.
